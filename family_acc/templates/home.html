    <h1> Hello </h1>
    <p>For some time, I have been searching for a simple and free system for tracking my income and expenses.
        As you may have guessed, the existence of this site indicates that I did not find one and decided to create it myself.
        It has only basic functionality and nothing superfluous.
    </br></br>
<h3>Registration</h3>
	The main idea is that users are grouped into families and keep financial records that are accessible to members of a specific family.
    The first family member registers independently, after which they can create accounts for other members of their family.
    Please fill in your email address carefully — a link will be sent to it to restore access if you forget your password.
</br></br>
    <h3>So how do you record income or expenses?</h3>
First, create currencies.
Then create accounts and specify which currency a particular account uses.
Accounts with different currencies can have the same names, for example, there can be accounts called “My cash (USD)” and “My cash (EUR)”.
Create an income or expense category.
Each category can be used only for income (Salary), only for expenses (Food), or for both income and expenses (Transfer between accounts).
Check the appropriate boxes “use for income” and “use for expenses” when creating a category.
</br></br>
Once you have an Account (and Currency) and Category, you can create a new financial transaction - new income or new expense.
When transferring money from one account to another, you need to create 2 transactions with the same amounts.
When transferring money from one account to another, you need to create two transactions with the same amounts.
For example, if you withdraw cash from an ATM, the first transaction will be an expense on the “Card” account and the second will be income on the “Cash” account.
All income is displayed with a positive amount, all expenses with a negative amount.
You don't need to think about the sign — the system will add it itself depending on whether you chose to create an expense or income.
</br></br>
<h3>Uploading and downloading data.</h3>
You will notice that on the relevant pages you have the option to upload or download data in csv format.
Although this option exists, you do not need to upload currencies, accounts, and categories before uploading transactions, as currencies, accounts,
and categories that are missing when uploading transactions will be created automatically.
The only thing you need to do after that is to enter the correct balance amounts in the accounts.
You can also go to the categories and uncheck “use for income” or “use for expenses” so that this category is not offered when entering income/loss
if it is not for that purpose.
</br></br>
